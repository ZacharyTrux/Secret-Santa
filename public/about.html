        The purpose of this website was to solve a 
        simple problem me and my family kept experiencing. 
        Secret Santa would always be difficult to communicate and establish
        what gifts have already been purchased by either someone's secret santa 
        or a family member already bought it. Thus this website came to be to
        hopefully solve this issue!
